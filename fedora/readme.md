# Fedora Customization

We need to install some packages to customize our Gnome desktop environment, such as themes, icons, fonts and extensions.

Such as: **Gnome Tweaks** to customize the desktop, **Extension Manager** to manage Gnome extensions, and some themes and icons to make our desktop look more beautiful.
